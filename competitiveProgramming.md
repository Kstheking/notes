### game of nim 
winning state, xor != 0   
losing state, xor == 0

 the Spragueâ€“Grundy theorem states that every impartial game under the normal play convention is equivalent to a one-heap game of nim, or to an infinite generalization of nim.   
 nimbers, also called Grundy numbers

### grundy number 
 a single grundy number can define the entire state and every impartial game has it.   
 grundy of any state = mex of (grundy of all states we can reach from the current one)  
 also equals to 0 for a losing state   

 - a grundy number of a state is the value of one heap game of nim it is equivalent to 
 -  if let's say from a state we can reach to grundy numbers of 0, 1 , 2 it means we can reach heap sizes of 0, 1 , 2 which means the current heap size and therefore the grundy number must be 3, that is why we use the mex 
 -  for independent impartial games together, like k knights on a chessboard which can be placed together, losing state can be xor of all their grundy numbers being equal to 0, and the vice versa 

### nim addition
  : for finite ordinals = xor of all heaps count
