# System Design 

## High Level Design (Architectural) 

- provide overview of entire system 
- non technical to mildly technical terms are used 

## Low level design (detailed) 

- provide details of logic of each component 
- detailed out by class and uml diagrams and relations 
- purely technical terms are used  

### steps 

- clarify the requirements 
- identify the objects 
- identify the relationships between the objects 
- derive the class diagram and add the methods into classes 
- implementing the classes with actual codes 

### SOLID 

- Single responsibility principle 
- Open/Closed priniciple 
- Liskov substitution principle 
- Interface segregation principle 
- Dependency inversion 

#### Single responsibility 

- a class should just shoulder one responsibility, i.e. one task, no point in cramming everything in one place 
- you can test bettter because you won't have to write intergration tests within the class 
- the class will be less coupled (how many dependencies it needs) since there is less overall code 
- better organization, divinding things into smaller meaningful distribution will always make them easier to understand 

#### Open/Close

- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification 
- one exception to the rule is when fixing bugs in existing code.
- can be implemented using inheritance 

#### liskov substitution 

- The principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application
- An overridden method of a subclass needs to accept the same input parameter values as the method of the superclass. the subclass method can not be more restricitve than superclass method 
- Similar rules apply to the return value of the method. The return value of a method of the subclass needs to comply with the same rules as the return value of the method of the superclass. 

#### Interface segregation 

-  it simply means that larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones.
-   By doing so, we can ensure that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the methods that are of interest to them.

#### Dependency Inversion 

-  High-level modules, which provide complex logic, should be easily reusable and unaffected by changes in low-level modules, which provide utility features. 
-  To achieve that, you need to introduce an abstraction that decouples the high-level and low-level modules from each other.
-  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
-  Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
-  It splits the dependency between the high-level and low-level modules by introducing an abstraction between them. So in the end, you get two dependencies:
-  the high-level module depends on the abstraction, and the low-level depends on the same abstraction.
-  If you consequently apply the Open/Closed Principle and the Liskov Substitution Principle to your code, it will also follow the Dependency Inversion Principle.
-  basically since now both high and low level module depend on abstraction rather than high level module depending on low level module, there is less coupling 
-  This enables you to change higher-level and lower-level components without affecting any other classes, as long as you donâ€™t change any interface abstractions.
